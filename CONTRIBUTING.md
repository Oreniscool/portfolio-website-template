Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before making any changes, create an issue explaining what you'd like to add or change and why.
2. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once the issue is discussed, submit a Pull Request with a clear description of what you are adding or changing.

Guidelines

- **Break Down Your Pull Requests**: Avoid creating a single PR for multiple features. Instead, break your PRs into meaningful parts to make review easier.
- **Avoid Spam Commits**: When adding a feature or fixing a bug, try not to create multiple small commits. Aim for clean, concise commit messages that clearly describe the changes.
